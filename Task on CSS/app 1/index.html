                <b>What is CSS?
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML (or sometimes XML). It controls the visual presentation of web pages — how elements appear in terms of layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="detail_description">
                        While HTML provides the structure of a webpage (e.g., paragraphs, headings, images), CSS is responsible for the styling — such as making text red, aligning content, or making a layout responsive for different devices.

                        How CSS Works
                    </h3>
                    <p class="detail_description">
                        CSS works by applying rules to HTML elements. A rule consists of a selector (which element to target) and a declaration block (the style to apply).<br/>
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and format HTML elements on a webpage. It works by selecting elements and applying rules that define their appearance, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. CSS can be written inline, inside a <b>style</b> tag, or in an external file. The browser reads both the HTML structure and CSS styles, then renders the content with the applied design. This separation of content and style makes web development cleaner and more efficient.

                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Inline CSS </b>– added directly inside HTML elements using the style attribute.<br/>

                            </li>
                            <li><b>Internal CSS</b> – placed inside a <b>style</b> tag within the <b>style</b> of the HTML file.<br/>
                            Example: <b style="color: blue;">style<br/>
