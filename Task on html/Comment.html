        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>
            In <small>HTML</small>, comments are used to leave notes or explanations within the code that are not displayed in the browser. They are helpful for developers to explain sections of code, temporarily disable elements, or make the code easier to understand for others (or for themselves in the future). 
        </p>

        <p>           
            An HTML comment starts with <b><large style="color: red;">!--</large></b> and ends with <b style="color:red;"><large>--></large></b>. Anything placed between these symbols will be ignored by the browser. For example, <!-- This is a comment --> will not appear on the web page. Comments are an important tool in web development for improving code readability and collaboration.
