        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, tables are used to present data in a clear and organized way using a grid made of rows and columns. A table begins with the table tag, and each row is defined by the <b>tr</b>(table row) tag. Inside each row, data is placed within <b>td</b> (table data) tags for standard cells, while <b>th</b> (table header) tags are used for header cells, which are typically bold and centered. To further organize the table content, developers can use <b>thead</b> for the header section, <b>tbody</b> for the main content, and <b>tfoot</b> for footer information. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, HTML provides attributes like `colspan` and `rowspan` that allow a cell to stretch across multiple columns or rows, enabling more complex layouts. Though tables were once used for overall page layout, they are now mainly used for displaying tabular data, such as schedules, reports, and comparisons. Tables remain an essential element in HTML for presenting structured information in a readable and accessible format.

        <h2>iframes</h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, an <b>iframe</b> (inline frame) is used to embed another webpage or external content within the current page. This allows you to display websites, videos, maps, or other documents inside a rectangular area defined by the iframe. The primary attribute used with <b>iframe</b> is `src`, which specifies the URL of the page or resource to be embedded. Other common attributes include `width`, `height`, and `title`, as well as `allowfullscreen` for enabling full-screen view (especially with videos). 
        </p>
        <p>
            For example: <iframe src="https://quran.com" width="600" height="400" title="Embedded Page"></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>
            Iframes are useful for integrating third-party content like YouTube videos, Google Maps, or PDF documents without redirecting users. However, excessive or insecure use of iframes can affect performance and raise security concerns, so they should be used thoughtfully and with trusted sources.
        </p>

        <h2>Input formats</h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, input formats refer to the various types of input fields that allow users to enter data in a web form. These input fields are created using the <b>input</b> tag, and the type attribute defines the format or kind of data expected. Each format provides a specific input method suited to the data being collected.
