        <h2>Page format and Images</h2>
        <h3><i>Page format</i></h3>
        <p>
            Formatting tags such as <b>strong</b> (bold) and <b>em</b> (italic) are used to emphasize text.
        </p>
        <h3><i>Images</i></h3>
        <p>
            In HTML, images are added to a webpage using the <b>img</b> tag. This tag is used to embed visual content such as photos, graphics, or icons, and it does not require a closing tag. The most important attribute of the img tag is <b>src</b> (source), which specifies the path or URL of the image file. Another essential attribute is <b>alt</b> (alternative text), which provides a text description of the image in case it cannot be displayed or for screen readers used by visually impaired users. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>For example</b>: <b style="color: red;">img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo"</b> will display the image named "logo.png" and show "Company Logo" as alt text if the image fails to load. Additional attributes like `width` and `height` can be used to control the image's size. Using images effectively enhances the visual appeal and user experience of a website.
